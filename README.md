# grpc.github.io
grpc.io website source.

The website uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) templates and is hosted on GitHub Pages. Please make sure you are familiar with these before editing.

Currently the site also uses client side LESS stylesheets that just work (through the included less.js script). Even though Jekyll supports SASS compilation - this has not yet been set up.
